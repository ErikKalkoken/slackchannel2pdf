## Limitations

- Text only: **slackchannel2pdf** will export only text from a channel, but not images or icons. This is by design.
- No Emojis: the tools is currently not able to write emojis as icons will will use their text representation instead (e.g. `:laughing:` instead of :laughing:).
- DMs, Group DM: Currently not supported
- Limited blocks support:Some non-text features of layout blocks not yet supported
- Limited script support: This tool is rendering all text with the [Google Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc) font and will therefore support all 500+ languages that are support by that font. It does however not support many Asian languages / scripts like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and others
